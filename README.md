# Notes
Client Project 
TEAM F MY F

* Wiki site
* Anyone can access and make a collection of articles for a group. ie. if they like cards, they can make pages for that.
* User roles
* guest
* administrator - BIG DOG - with deleting access 
* other administrators selected by big dog
* author/regular user - create, edit, delete, update
* I want user authentication with a username
* However, if there isn’t a username, I still want access to the information as a guest
* As an administrator, I want special rules - able to delete articles; and decide who else is an administrator
* Would also like to have image functionality
* Article
* Title
* summary paragraph
* images
* Sections
* Categories - Article can have many categories (low priority)
* Footnotes, bibliography should be included
* Article Status options
* Drafts
* Published
* Published but needs more information

* Big Dog WIKI?
* Administrator needs to be called BIG DOG
* “Brain puppy of big dog duke”

* Home page with featured articles (either by views - not sure exactly what yet)
* Needs search functionality whether logged in or not
* When making an article, would like to be able to do basic formatting — bold and italics — with a  preview
* version history

## Priorities:
* Create article, view articles, view pictures, section navigation. Note: Big dog is more important than guest role
* schema, relationships
* CRUD
